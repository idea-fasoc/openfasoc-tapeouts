Comparator
===============
A comparator is a circuit, which compares the two inputs that are applied to it and produces an output. In this folder, it contains several conparators designs and the files to run and analyze the simulation. If there is a new design, you may want to use the spice file to simulate it and use python to generate the offset plot.
